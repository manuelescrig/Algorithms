Arrays and Strings Questions
*/

class CCIArraysStrings {

  /*
  1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique
  characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
  */

  /*
  1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
  other.
  */

  /*
  1.3 CURLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You
  may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the
  additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
  (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
  perform this operation in place.).
  */

  /*
  1.4 Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is
  a permutation of a palin- drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the
  same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.The
  palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
  */


  /*
  1.5 One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings:
  insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two
  strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
  */


  /*
  1.6 String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression
  using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa
  would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller
  than the original string, your method should return the original string. You
  can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
  */

  /*
  1.7 Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each
  pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90
  degrees. (an you do this in place?
  */

  /*
  1.8 Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix
  is 0, its entire row and column are set to O.
  */


  /*
  1.9 String Rotation: Assume you have amethod isSubstring which checks ifone
  word is asubstring of another. Given two strings, 51 and 52, write code to
  check if 52 is a rotation of 51 using only one call to isSubstring
  (e.g.,"waterbottle"is a rotation of"erbottlewat")
  */

  /*
  16.8 English Int: Given any integer, print an English phrase that describes
  the integer (e.g., "One Thou- sand, Two Hundred Thirty Four").
  */

  /*
  16.17 Contiguous Sequence: You are given an array of integers (both positive
  and negative). Find the contiguous sequence with the largest sum. Return
  the sum.
  */

  /*

  */

  /*
  17.4 Missing Number: An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except
  for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire
  integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in
  binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is constant time..
  do it in constant time.
