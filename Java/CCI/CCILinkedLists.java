Linkded List Questions
*/

class CCILinkedLists {

  /*
  2.1 Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
  */

  /*
  2.2 Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last
  element of a singly linked list.
  */

  /*
  2.3 Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle
  (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle)
  of a singly linked list, given only access to that node
  */

  /*
  2.4 Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x,
  such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal
  to x. lf x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after
  the elements less than x (see below).The partition element x can appear
  anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the
  left and right partitions.
  */


  /*
  2.5 Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each
  node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such
  that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds
  the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
  */


  /*
  2.6 Palindrome: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
  */


  /*
  2.7
  Intersection: Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists
  intersect. Return the inter- secting node. Note that the intersection is
  defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first
  linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the
  second linked list, then they are intersecting.
  */


  /*
  2.8 Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm
  that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.
  */



  /*
  7.12 Hash Table: Design and implement a hash table which uses chaining
  (linked lists) to handle collisions.
  */


  /*
  16.25 LRU Cache: Design and build a "least recently used" cache, which evicts
  the least recently used item. The cache should map from keys to values
  (allowing you to insert and retrieve a value associ- ated with a particular
  key) and be initialized with a max size. When it is full, it should evict
  the least recently used item.
  */


  /*
  17.12 BiNode: Consider a simple data structure called BiNode,
  which has pointers to two other nodes.
  public class BiNode {
    public BiNode nodel, node2;
    public int data;
  }
  The data structure BiNode could be used to represent both a binary tree
  (where nodel is the left node and node2 is the right node) or a
  doubly linked list (where nodel is the previous node and node2 is the
  next node). Implement a method to convert a binary search tree
  (implemented with BiNode) into a doubly linked list. The values should be
  kept in order and the operation should be performed in place (that is,
  on the original data structure).
